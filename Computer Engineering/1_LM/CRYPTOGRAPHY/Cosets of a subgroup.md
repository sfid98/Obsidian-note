We need to introduce the concept of cosets of a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$.
**Definition**
Let $(G, +)$ be an abelian group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. We say
that two elements $g_1$ and $g_{}2$ $∈ G$ are congruent modulus (or modulo) $H$,
written $g_{1} ≡ g_{2} \text{ mod} H$, if and only if $g_{1} − g_{2} ∈ H$.
Congruence modulo a subgroup of G is an equivalence relation and
partitions the elements of G into disjoint equivalence classes.

**Definition**
The equivalence classes for congruence modulo H are called cosets of H.
Thus, $∀g ∈ G$
$$
[g]=\{x\in G:x-g\in H\}=\{x\in G:x=h+g,~h\in H\}
$$
And hence
$$[g]=\{h+g|h\in H\}$$

We denote $[g]$ mod $H$ by $g + H$.

**Remark** $$\forall g\in G\left.|g+H|=|[g]|=|\{h+g|h\in H\}|=|H|.\right. $$
Thus: $|G| =|H|t$, where t is the number of cosets of $H$

$C$ has $t = |Fq_{n} |/|Fq_{k} | = q^n /q^k  = q^{n−k}$ cosets
