Let $p$ be a prime and let a be any integer. Then,
$$a^p ≡ a \text{ mod  }$$
Proof. 
Let us consider the multiplicative group $(Z_p \backslash \{0\}, ·)$ where $p$ is a prime. It has order $p − 1$ and hence $a^{p−1} = 1$ for all $a ∈ Z_p \backslash \{0\}$
Hence, $a^p ≡ a$ mod $p$ for all $a ∈ Z$ and our theorem follows.
