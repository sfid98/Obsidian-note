Let $C$ be a $k$ dimensional vector subspace of $F_q^n$. The ortogonal complement $C^\perp$ of C is. See [[ortogonal vector]]
$$
C^\perp = \{x \in F_{q}^n : x\cdot y = 0 \text{ }∀y ∈ C\}
$$
$C^\perp$ is referred to as the **dual code** of C.

###### Theorem
If $C$ is an $(n,k)$-code over $F_q$, then $C^\perp$ is an $(n,n-k)$-code over $F_q$.
Furthermore, if G is a generator matrix of C then
$$
x \in C^\perp \iff xG^T = 0
$$
