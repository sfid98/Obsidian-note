## Euler’s Theorem
Let $a ∈ Z$, $2 ≤ n ∈ Z$. If $(a, n) = 1$ then the following holds:
$$a^{\phi(n)} ≡ 1 \text{ mod n}$$
Proof. Since $|Un | = \phi(n)$ we have that $∀a ∈ U_n$, $a^Φ(n) = 1$, that is, if
$(a, n) = 1$ then, $a^Φ(n) ≡ 1$ mod $n$.

## Fermat's little Theorem
Let $p$ be a prime and let a be any integer. Then,
$$a^p ≡ a \text{ mod  }$$
Proof. 
Let us consider the multiplicative group $(Z_p \backslash \{0\}, ·)$ where $p$ is a prime. It has order $p − 1$ and hence $a^p−1 = 1$ for all $a ∈ Z_p \backslash \{0\}$
Hence, $a^p ≡ a$ mod $p$ for all $a ∈ Z$ and our theorem follows.
