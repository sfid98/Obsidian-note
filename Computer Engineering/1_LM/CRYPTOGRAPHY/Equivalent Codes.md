**Definition**
Two $F_{q}$ -linear codes are called (linearly) equivalent if one is obtained from the other by means of a sequence of operations of the following types:
1. permutation of the positions of the code;
2. multiplication of symbols in a fixed position by a non-zero scalar in$F_q$ .
It is possible to prove that when we apply one of these operations (to every element of the code) we obtain a new code which is still a linear code.

**Theorem**
Let C be a linear $(n, k)$-code having generator matrix $G$. If we perform on
$G$ the following operations:
1. permutation of rows;
2. multiplication of a row by a non-zero scalar in Fq ;
3. addition of a scalar multiple of one row to another;
4. permutation of columns;
5. multiplication of a column by a non-zero scalar; we obtain a matrix which generates a code equivalent to C .
**It is easy to see that two equivalent codes have the same parameters.**
