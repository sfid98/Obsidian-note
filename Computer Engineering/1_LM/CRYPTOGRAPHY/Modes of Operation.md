In cryptography, the mode of operation of block ciphers **is a series of standard procedures of an algorithm**  that operates through block ciphers to guarantee the security of texts or messages of any length.

The modes were initially defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1980 with the FIPS 81 standard entitled Data Encryption Standard modes of operation so that the DES encryption algorithm could be applied to a variety of different situations.


These modes can be used with any symmetric block cipher algorithm, including Triple DES and AES
