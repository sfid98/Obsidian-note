A _permutation matrix_ **P** is a [square matrix](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/square-matrix "Learn more about square matrix from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of order _n_ such that each line (a line is either a row or a column) contains one element equal to 1, the remaining elements of the line being equal to 0. The simplest permutation matrix is **I**, the [identity matrix](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/identity-matrix "Learn more about identity matrix from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). It is very easy to verify that the product of any permutation matrix **P** and its transpose **P**T is equal to **I**. Thus:

and **P** is an [orthogonal matrix](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/orthogonal-matrix "Learn more about orthogonal matrix from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). If a matrix with _n_ rows is pre-multiplied by **P**, its rows are permuted. Similarly, the _n_ columns of a matrix are permuted by post-multiplication with a permutation matrix.

**P** can be stored in the computer memory as a vector of integers: the integer at position _i_ is the column index of the unit element of row _i_ of **P**.
