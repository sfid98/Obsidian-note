###### Theorem

If $G$ is a finite group and $a \in G$ then $a^{o(G)} = 1$

Proof. If $a$ has order $m$, then $|<a>| =m$, and from Langrange's Theorem $m$ is a divisor of $O(g)$, say $o(G)=mq$.
Then, $a^{o(G)} = a^{mq}=(a^m)^q = 1^q=1$

###### Proposition
Let $n \in N$, $n\geq 2$. Then, $U_{n} = \{[x] \in Z_{n} |(x,n)=1\}$ is a group with respect to the multiplication mod n

Proof #proof 
Let $[a]$ and $[b]$ be two elements of $U_{n}$ . Since $(a, n) = 1 = (b, n)$
then $(ab, n) = 1$. Hence $[ab] ∈ U_n{}$. Furthermore, the multiplication
mod $n$ is associative, $[1] ∈ U_{n}$ and it easy to see that each element of $U_{n}$
has its multiplicative inverse mod $n$ in $U_{n}$ . Therefore, $U_{n}$ is a group.
**Remark** A complete set of representatives of all distinct elements in $U_{n}$ is
the set of positive integers not exceeding n and coprime to n. Hence, the
order of $U_{n}$ is $Φ(n)$.
