A message is divided into block, each of them contains a given number n of symbols. Generally these symbol are bits ad $n=64,128$. For each key $k$ there is a cryptographic function $E_k$ that maps each block to a block of the same length. 
The Feistel cipher is an example of a block cipher. This cipher alternates substitution and permutations and realize [[Diffusion]] and [[Confusion]]
