Another advantage offered by linear codes is that a linear code can be characterized by the following matrix.
**Definition**
A generator matrix $G$ for an $(n, k)$-code $C$ is a $k Ã— n$ matrix whose rows form a basis for $C$.
If $G$ is a generator matrix of a linear code $C$ then the codewords of $C$ are all linear combinations of the rows of $G$.
We say that $C$ is the code generated by $G$.
Observe that the dimension k of the code C is the rank of the matrix $G$.
The basis of a vector space is not unique, neither is the generator matrix G for a linear code.
If we perform on G the following operations:
1. permutation of rows,
2. multiplication of a row by a non-zero scalar in Fq ,
3. addition of a scalar multiple of one row to another,we obtain a new matrix which generates the same code.
We obtain a new matrix which generates the same code.

**Theorem**
If $C$ is an $(n, k)$-code over $F_{q}$ then there exists a generator matrix $G$ for $C$ or for one equivalent code $C'$ such that
$$G = [I_{k} A]$$
An $(n, k)$-code $C$ over $F_{}q$ can be characterized in terms of another subspace, the orthogonal complement of $C$.

**Remark**
If it is possible to find a generator matrix in standard form for a linear code $C$. Then the information symbols will occur in the first $k$ position of each codeword of $C$
