Another advantage offered by linear codes is that a linear code can becharacterized by the following matrix.
**Definition**
A generator matrix $G$ for an $(n, k)$-code $C$ is a $k Ã— n$ matrix whose rows
form a basis for $C$.
If $G$ is a generator matrix of a linear code $C$ then the codewords of $C$ are
all linear combinations of the rows of $G$.
We say that $C$ is the code generated by $G$.
Observe that the dimension k of the code C is the rank of the matrix $G$.
The basis of a vector space is not unique, neither is the generator matrix
G for a linear code.
If we perform on G the following operations:
1. permutation of rows,
2. multiplication of a row by a non-zero scalar in Fq ,
3. addition of a scalar multiple of one row to another,we obtain a new matrix which generates the same code.
